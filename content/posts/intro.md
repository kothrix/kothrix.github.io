# Welcome

This is a Jekyll-based documentation site, hosted on GitHub, created for one main purpose:  
**to record the long, complicated journey of trying to rebuild a life that slipped off track.**

I’m writing all of this not because I want attention, but because I need a place to sort out what happened, who I’ve become, and who I’m trying to grow into.

## 🌑 How Things Fell Apart

A few years ago, during the early part of my teens, things started going wrong in ways I didn’t recognize at the time. I was studying from home, trying to teach myself most subjects, and somehow I kept passing—though looking back, I can’t explain how. Maybe I understood more than I realized, or maybe I relied on shortcuts I don’t fully remember.

Then everything began to slide.

My laptop broke, my motivation disappeared, and instead of trying to keep up, I waited… and waited. By the time it was fixed, I was far behind. Instead of facing the work, I convinced myself it was pointless. I stopped listening to lessons, started using easy tools to get through assignments, and let months pass without real learning.

I told myself none of it mattered. That my life wasn’t important. That someone else would handle the responsibilities I was supposed to prepare for.

For more than a year, I kept sinking into that way of thinking.

## ⚡ The Moment Everything Shifted

What finally shook me wasn’t fear for myself — it was something that affected my family. Someone I relied on started struggling in ways none of us expected. The person I thought would always “handle things” couldn’t anymore. And suddenly, the position I had avoided all this time… was empty.

It hit me hard:  
**if I didn’t step up, no one else would.**

That realization didn’t magically fix everything, but it snapped something inside me awake. It gave me a sense of responsibility I didn’t know I could feel. For the first time in years, I wanted to fight for something — not just for myself, but for the people who would do anything for me.

## 📚 Starting Over (Even When It Feels Too Late)

Right after my last birthday, I decided to rebuild myself from scratch.  
I began studying math again, aiming to prepare for the SAT next year. I rushed through the first units of Algebra 1, but then reality hit — the deeper I went, the more I realized how much I had lost.

Even simple ideas felt confusing.  
Patterns didn’t click.  
My logic felt slow.  
My mind felt untrained.

On the fourth day, I hit a wall so simple that it scared me.  
And yes — I stopped. I failed that attempt.

But for the first time, I didn’t feel defeated. I felt… aware.  
Aware that something needed changing at the root: my way of thinking.

## 🧩 Beyond Math

Math is a goal, but it’s not the only path I’m walking.

I’m learning 3D modeling, working through a course I nearly finished, and exploring other fields that interest me. These skills matter to me — they show me I *can* learn, even if I’m not where I want to be yet.

But math is the foundation I’m determined to repair.  
Without it, I feel like I can’t build the future I want.

My goal is bold:  
**Master Algebra 1 and 2 within the next 44 days.**  
I might fail. I might fall behind.  
But I’d rather try with everything I have than look back years from now and regret not even attempting it.

## 🌱 Why I’m Documenting Everything

This site is a place to:

- track my progress honestly  
- record the thoughts I’m too afraid to say out loud  
- stay accountable when motivation fades  
- look back later and see how far I’ve come  
- prove to myself that change is possible  

I don’t want my family to just be relieved that I’m improving.  
I want them to be proud — because they deserve that, and because I want to be someone worth being proud of.

## 🟦 The Journey Starts Here

I don’t know how far I’ll get.  
I don’t know how long it will take.  
But this is where I choose to try.

This documentation is the story of someone who almost gave up —  
and is learning, slowly, step by step, how not to.
